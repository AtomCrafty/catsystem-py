# catsystem-py

Work-in-progress library created in unison with reversing the CatSystem 1 and 2 VN engines.

**Python Package Name:** `catsys`

**Warning:** The default branch is named `unstable` for a reason. This library has gone through countless changes, refactors, and rewrites. Some fueled by new knowledge about the Python language, and others purely because of OCD (yes literally).
