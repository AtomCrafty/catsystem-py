# catsystem-py

Work-in-progress library created in unison with reversing the CatSystem 1 and 2 VN engines.

**Python Package Name:** `catsys`

**Warning:** The default branch is named `unstable` for a reason. This library has gone through countless changes, refactors, and rewrites. Some fueled by new knowledge about the Python language, and others purely because of OCD (yes literally).


This library is heavily tied to [TriggersTools.CatSystem2](https://github.com/trigger-segfault/TriggersTools.CatSystem2), and more importantly, the repo's [Wiki knowledge base](https://github.com/trigger-segfault/TriggersTools.CatSystem2/wiki).
